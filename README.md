<p>This Property Management System is designed to assist landlords to keep track of their properties from individual tenants and individual units in their properties, rent paid by the tenants, reservations made by potential tenants and many more.</p>
<p>Also the system allows tenants to quickly and easily pay for their rent via bank or via an mpesa transaction. The system also allows the to view details about their assigned unit from the size in SQM and all the available amenities for that unit.</p>
<p>The system also advertises all the vacant units form the landlord properties in a properties page, where potential tenants can view the unit details and reserve any unit they are interested in so as to keep it from being taken by somebody else.</p>
<p>The system also offers extra services to both the landord and the tenants, these services include:</p>
